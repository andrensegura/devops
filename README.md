# Tools I've made for my company

* **acctdiag**: used to diagnose a cPanel account and check for issues like suspension, disk quota issues, incorrect htaccess directives, etc.

* **blockattackers**: blocks any IP making more than the given amount of connections.

* **chkes**: "Certified Hosting Kayako Enhancement Suite." A chrome extension created to make some work in self-hosted Kayako quicker, thus making the users more productive.

* **createDatabase**: creates a database, a user, and provides permission to that user. The credentials are then spit out. The database is mapped to the correct cPanel user, if applicable.

* **cwd**: changes your working directory to the document root of the domain provided.

* **extract**: instead of figuring out what tool to use, just use extract.

* **globalsexploitscanner**: a malware scanner for a specific breed of malware found in WordPress installations. Outdated now. Haven't seen that exploit in years.

* **killzombie**: kills zombie php processes

* **listallips**: shows IPs on the server, available or unavailable.

* **listreseller**: shows all domains associated with a reseller account on cPanel servers.

* **ncple**: "Non-CPanel Let's Encrypt." This script issues and manages Let's Encrypt SSL's on non-cPanel servers.

* **wlmodsec**: whitelists a ModSecurity rule for a cPanel user. Doesn't work with current versions of cPanel. It wasn't updated because it became less necessary.
